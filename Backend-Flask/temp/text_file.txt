<TITLE>It was raining very hard and he had a very large umbrella to keep off the rain-drops.</TITLE>
<TITLE>The manubrium bearing the gonads is mouthless, and the umbrella is without tentacles, sense-organs, velum or radial canals.</TITLE>
<TITLE>It differs from Limnocodium in having practically no manubrium but a wide mouth two-thirds the diameter of the umbrella across.</TITLE>
